# project-1 : Five Little Ducks

EXPLANATION: 
The game is designed to help children age 2+ learn how to count to 5. The game is based on the old nursery rhyme song ‘Five Little Ducks’. With each verse, 
one of the ducks goes away so eventually, there is only one mother duck left. However, when she calls her little ducks, they all come back at the end of the 
game so there are 5 little ducks again all together. 

The idea of the game is that the user clicks on the mother duck on the left side of the game field (called duckField) and on-click, it starts the first verse 
of the song. The user has to understand that at the beginning of the game, there were  5 ducks. Then, when the user clicks on the second mother duck, it sings 
the second verse of the song starting with 4 little ducks. At this point, the user is prompted to count to 1 and verify their answer by clicking on one of the 
squares on the right side of the game field(called myField) in the corresponding line. When the user clicks on yellow squares, only one of them turns to the 
little duck picture. As the user keeps on clicking on the mother ducks on the left side, he/she sees that with each click, one of the ducks are gone but appear 
on the right side of the game field. For example, when clicked on line 6 mother duck, all 5 little ducks disappear on the left side of the game field but the 
user can click on all 5 little ducks appearing on the right side of the field. 

On the last line of the game, all 5 little ducks are together which accompanies by the repeated last words of the song saying that all the five little 
ducks came back. This is where the user learned to count to 5 and wins the game! The close button resets the game.

USER STORY:
I enjoyed playing this game because it teaches me to count to 5. If I am not sure if my answers are right, I can always check when I click on the yellow 
squares and the little ducks pop up. What a fun! I like the song too and sing along.
